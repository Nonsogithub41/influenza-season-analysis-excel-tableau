# Project Overview
This project aims to assist a medical staffing agency in preparing for the upcoming influenza season by analyzing trends in influenza cases and deaths. The objective is to create a staffing plan that ensures adequate coverage across the United States, minimizing both understaffing and overstaffing situations.

## Tools Used
- Excel: Data cleaning, transformation, and initial analysis.
- Tableau: Data visualization and storytelling.
## Data Sources
The analysis uses data from various sources, which can be downloaded directly:

Research Questions
When does influenza season start and end in each state?
How do vulnerable populations impact staffing needs?
Which states should be prioritized based on the severity of influenza?
Cleaning Procedures
The following steps were performed to prepare the data for analysis:

Handling Missing Data: Addressed missing values through imputation where necessary.
Standardizing Formats: Ensured consistency in date and numeric formats.
Removing Duplicates: Identified and removed duplicate records.
Data Transformation: Integrated data from multiple sources into a cohesive dataset.
Analysis and Insights
Temporal Analysis: Identified the start and end of influenza season in each state using Excel.
Vulnerable Populations: Assessed the impact of vulnerable groups on staffing needs using Excel.
Visualization: Used Tableau to create interactive visualizations, including time series, heat maps, and correlation charts.
Correlation Analysis: Investigated the relationship between influenza rates and staffing requirements.
Tableau Dashboard
The final insights and visualizations were compiled into a Tableau dashboard for interactive exploration.
