# Influenza-season-analysis-excel-tableau
# Project Overview
This project aims to assist a medical staffing agency in preparing for the upcoming influenza season by analyzing trends in influenza cases and deaths. The objective is to create a staffing plan that ensures adequate coverage across the United States, minimizing both understaffing and overstaffing situations.

## Tools Used
- Excel: Data cleaning, transformation, and initial analysis.
- Tableau: Data visualization and storytelling.
## Data Sources
The analysis uses data from various sources, which can be downloaded directly:

1. **[Influenza Deaths by Geography, Time, Age, and Gender](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fcoach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fcourses%2Fda_program%2FCDC_Influenza_Deaths_edited.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK)**
Source: CDC

2. **[Population Data by Geography](https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/data-immersion/A1-A2_Influenza_Project/Census_Population_transformed_202101.csv)** 
Source: US Census Bureau

## Research Questions
When does influenza season start and end in each state?
How do vulnerable populations impact staffing needs?
Which states should be prioritized based on the severity of influenza?

## Cleaning Procedures
The following steps were performed to prepare the data for analysis:

1. Handling Missing Data: Addressed missing values through imputation where necessary.
2. Standardizing Formats: Ensured consistency in date and numeric formats.
3. Removing Duplicates: Identified and removed duplicate records.
4. Data Transformation: Integrated data from multiple sources into a cohesive dataset.
   
## Analysis and Insights
- Temporal Analysis: Identified the start and end of influenza season in each state using Excel.
- Vulnerable Populations: Assessed the impact of vulnerable groups on staffing needs using Excel.
- Visualization: Used Tableau to create interactive visualizations, including time series, heat maps, and correlation charts.
- Correlation Analysis: Investigated the relationship between influenza rates and staffing requirements.
  
## Tableau Dashboard
The final insights and visualizations were compiled into a Tableau dashboard for interactive exploration.
